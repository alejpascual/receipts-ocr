# Critical Fixes Based on February Review Feedback

## Issues Identified from Corrections

### 1. **Screenshot Date Parsing Completely Wrong**
- File: `Screenshot 2025-08-01 at 16.38.pdf`
- Parsed as: `2025-02-03` 
- Should be: `2025-02-03` (if the transaction date in the receipt was actually Feb 3)
- **Problem**: Filename dates are being used incorrectly, or OCR is severely misreading receipt dates

### 2. **Missing Railway VPS Classification**
- Service: Railway VPS (¥804)
- Should be: Software and Services
- **Problem**: Missing hosting/server keywords in category rules

### 3. **Amount Parsing Issues**
- Multiple receipts may have had wrong amounts selected
- Need better validation of amount selection logic

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Software Services Detection
**File**: `rules/categories.yml`
Added hosting and server keywords:
- VPS, Virtual Private Server, Railway, Vercel, Heroku
- AWS, GCP, Azure, Server, Hosting, Domain, SSL, CDN

### 2. Date Parsing Validation Needed
**Critical Issue**: Need to investigate why screenshot dates are wrong
- Check if filename dates are interfering with receipt content dates
- Validate date extraction from actual receipt content vs filename

### 3. Amount Validation Enhancement Needed
**Issue**: Need to verify amount selection is working correctly
- Check frequency analysis is working
- Validate amounts against receipt totals

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Test Date Parsing on Screenshot Files**
   - Create debug script to check what date is being extracted from receipt content
   - Ensure filename dates don't override receipt dates

2. **Validate Amount Selection**
   - Debug amount parsing on the corrected receipts
   - Ensure ¥2040, ¥1780, ¥1089 are being selected correctly

3. **Test Railway VPS Detection**
   - Verify new keywords catch hosting services
   - Test classification confidence for server/hosting receipts

## Prevention Protocol

1. **For Screenshot Files**: Always extract date from receipt content, never from filename
2. **For Hosting Services**: Expand VPS/server/hosting keyword detection
3. **For Amount Selection**: Implement better logging to show why specific amounts were chosen
4. **Regular Testing**: Create test cases for common receipt types (restaurants, software, hosting)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Software Services Detection ✅
**File**: `rules/categories.yml`
- Added VPS, Railway, Vercel, Heroku, AWS, GCP, Azure keywords
- Added hosting, server, domain, SSL, CDN keywords
- **Result**: Railway VPS now correctly classified as Software and Services

### 2. Fixed Amount Selection Issues ✅
**File**: `src/parse.py`
- Added logic to reduce priority for suspiciously small amounts (< ¥100) when much larger amounts exist
- Enhanced frequency-based boosting for amounts that appear multiple times
- Added special boost for amounts appearing before 合計 if they appear multiple times
- Added debug logging to show all amount candidates and selection reasoning

**Results**:
- CanDo receipt: Improved from ¥40 to ¥400 (closer to expected ¥440)
- Better detection of amounts that appear multiple times in receipts
- More intelligent handling of small tax amounts vs actual totals

### 3. Date Parsing Investigation ✅
**Finding**: Screenshot date parsing was actually CORRECT
- Screenshot file correctly parsed 2025-02-03 from receipt content, not filename
- System properly ignored filename date (2025-08-01)
- No changes needed for date parsing

### 4. Enhanced Debugging ✅
**Files**: `debug_february_issues.py`, `debug_amount_selection.py`
- Created comprehensive debugging tools
- Added detailed logging for amount selection process
- Can now trace exactly why specific amounts are chosen

## Verification Results

✅ **Railway VPS Classification**: Working perfectly (confidence: 1.00)
✅ **Date Parsing**: Correctly ignores filenames, uses receipt content  
🔄 **Amount Selection**: Significantly improved, but some edge cases remain
✅ **Category Keywords**: Hosting/server services now properly detected
✅ **Debugging Tools**: Can now trace and fix parsing issues systematically

## Remaining Improvements Needed

1. **Fine-tune Amount Selection**: The ¥2040 vs ¥1854 case still needs work
2. **Better Tax Detection**: Improve detection of tax amounts vs totals
3. **Receipt Structure Recognition**: Better understanding of Japanese receipt layouts

## Key Learnings Applied

1. **Debug First**: Always examine actual OCR text before assuming parsing errors
2. **Multiple Occurrence Boost**: Amounts appearing multiple times are usually correct
3. **Context Matters**: Small amounts after 合計 are suspicious if large amounts exist
4. **Comprehensive Keywords**: Keep expanding categories based on real receipt types
